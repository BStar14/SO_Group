    "__Delivery Reward Maximization(DRM)__ is a optimization problem. Suppose there are customers who want your goods. But you have limited time. Customers don't wait forever. Then how can you maximize your profit? __DRM__ will give you an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before telling what __DRM__ is, define the problem mathematically. Let $V=\\{v_1,v_2,\\cdots,v_n\\}$ be the nodes, the customers, and $v_0$ be your store. Each customer has deadline $d(v_i)$ and reword $c(v_i)$. Your vehicle's speed is $s$. Path is denoted as edge. Weights of egdes $w(e_i,e_j)$ represent distance. There is also service time $t(v_i)$ that may represent the time needed to pass the goods. __DRM__ algorithm is hard. In this project, we consider a special case called __LDRM(Line Delivery Reward Maximization)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "We modified __LDRM__ little. Assume that $v_0$ is at origin and customers were numbered sequentially, that is, nodes will like this $v_0,v_1,v_2,\\cdots$. We added varibales $x_{11},x_{22},\\cdots$ which represent whether the solution ends at $v_i$ or not. Also set variables $x_{ij}$, which implies that airplane stop by $j$th airport whose final destination is $i$. We added a constraint that $\\sum\\limits_{j<i} x_{ij}-ix_{ii}\\leq 0$. Note that $x_{ii}$ is 1 if and only if the final destination is $i$. Then there are $i$ possible airport that airplane can stop by. So when $x_{ii}=0$, $x_{ij}$ is 0 for all $j$. Otherwise, airplane can choose airport before its destination."

    "Suppose the depot is in Incheon. You may deliver you goods by airplane. Since your goods require extremly cold environment, there is few airplane that can carry your goods. In this case, assume that only one airplane is available. Customers are in Shanghai, Hanoi and Suvarnabhmi. Roughly speaking, they are in a line fortunately. So this problem can be converted into __LDRM__."

    "There are many __NP-HARD__ problems in real world. Any computer, even a supercomputer, can solve these problems. It is impossible to get exact solution. But if we don't have to get the best solution, if we can be satisfied with optimized solution, we can get a solution faster. Still, for large data, some optimization algorithm are slow. In this case quantum computing can be a solution. Using quantum speedup, one can get optimized solution in reasonable time."
